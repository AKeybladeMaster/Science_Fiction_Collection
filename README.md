# Science_Fiction_Collection

This Java program let's you execute some operations on a collection of romances.

It also has an option to dump on a .txt file all the elements in the list of romances if needed.

The main functions are:
- adding
- deleting
- searching by title
- searching by author (all of his/her romances)
- searching by year (less/greater than)
- searching by a filter (by typing an author and the format of the romance)

I'm open to any suggestion! Enjoy!
